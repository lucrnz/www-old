            Hey! My name is Lucien, Welcome to my site :) First of all, it is really cool that you
            dont use JavaScript. I know some tech-oriented people dont like the idea of running
            foreign code on their computers all the time, and thats good! But unfortunately, I
            created this site to practice my front-end skills As deploying a simple blog with a
            generator based on Markdown files or PHP was not really fun at all for me. Thats is all
            the plain text content I can give for now.. :) Maybe I will setup some proxy or RSS for
            accesing my content as plain text, but no plan or promises at the moment.
