# Luc/Lucie/Lucien website old code

Hi, this is [my website](https://lucdev.net) old code

It parses markdown on the client side and has a Node + TypeScript backend

You can read [the article](https://lucdev.net/blog/20220928-hello-world/) to know how I created the site and what were my ideas at the moment

# Getting started

You need Node.js - I used [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage the install locally

You need the [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) node package manager

Install the packages

    pnpm i

Run the backend

    pnpm run start:server

Run the front-end

    pnpm run dev
