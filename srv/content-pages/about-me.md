# About me

My Name is Lucien, I am 27 years old. I go by they/them pronouns.
I am a developer from Argentina.

# Hobbies: Programming

I learned programming by myself, I find it enjoyable to create programs or scripts that solves problems.
I work as a fullstack software developer at a known international company, but I enjoy a lot more front-end.
My tech skills include but are not limited to: JavaScript, C#, Go and a little bit of C.
Even tho I dont wanna touch C ever again.
Originally I created this website to practice my front-end development skills.

# Hobbies: General

Apart from programming I enjoy gaming (both PC and VR), going out for a walk, working
out, watching cartoons or tv shows, and generally enjoying my time with my partner.

I have my own definition of nihilism, I try to re-think how I interact with everything
and find my own conclusions about them.

While I try to remain positive as I found out that being too realistic or negative is depressive.

I identify as gender non-binary, as I dont associate with either cultural masculiny or
femininity, I enjoy creating my own meaning of gender expression. I fully support LGBTQIA+.

I believe everyone should be treated the same regardless of gender, and that people should show their own interests instead of what society tells them to do.

Killing animals for own pleasure or enjoyment is bad and should not be done.

I don't believe in modern feminism as It seems to be hembrism or female-side sexism.
