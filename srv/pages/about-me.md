# Life views

I have my own definition of nihilism, I try to re-think how I interact with everything
and find my own conclusions about them.

I identify as gender non-binary, as I dont associate with either cultural masculiny or
femininity, I enjoy creating my own meaning of gender expression. I fully support LGBTQIA+.

I believe everyone should treat each other respectfully regardless of gender, and that they should show their own interests instead of what society tells them to do.
