# About me

My Name is Lucien, I am 27 years old. I go by they/them pronouns.
I am a developer from Argentina.

# Hobbies: Programming

I learned programming by myself, I find it enjoyable to create programs or scripts that solves problems.
I work as a fullstack software developer at a known international company, but I enjoy a lot more front-end.
My tech skills include but are not limited to: JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, Go, Python and a little bit of C.
Even tho I dont wanna touch C ever again.
I wish to learn Rust sometime!

# Hobbies: General

Apart from programming I enjoy gaming (both PC and VR), going out for a walk, working
out, watching cartoons or tv shows, and generally enjoying my time with my partner.

# Life views

I have my own definition of nihilism, I try to re-think how I interact with everything
and find my own conclusions about them.

While I try to remain positive as I found out that being too realistic or negative is depressive.

I identify as gender non-binary, as I dont associate with either cultural masculiny or
femininity, I enjoy creating my own meaning of gender expression. I fully support LGBTQIA+.

I believe everyone should be treated the same regardless of gender, and that people should show their own interests instead of what society tells them to do.

I believe killing animals for own pleasure or enjoyment is bad and should not be done.
