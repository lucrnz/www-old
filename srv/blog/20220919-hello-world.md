# Hello World - Why I created my website after 10 years

Finally, after coding for hours non-stop, and reading a lot of blogs while wishing to have my own, I can start mine. It's been a while since I have a website... probably around 10 years.

I enjoy lurking, it's how I am, creating textual content was not something that I really had in mind at that moment.

Blogs are probably an overused type for a personal site, but who cares? Writing about random stuff sounds really fun!

# Programming

I started coding this site around 10 days ago, looking back it is over-engineered in a way, because I really wanted an SPA,
there are a lot of tools to easily get a blog running, but I just didn't wanted to take the easy path.

My own hand-crafted site, my original idea was to even create a JS framework, but I ditched it inmediately after
realizing it wasn't that easy: state management, know when to re-render components. I wanted all. Of course, I gave up.

React is a really popular library, and It was my first components experience, it changed my way of thinking about UI completely but It has a big problem: over-head and bundle size.

For a while I was absent from web development and refused to use Node or Npm while just using Vanilla JavaScript for interaction code, having bad experiences with big libraries like JQuery and poor architecture.

Right now, the world is full of alternatives, pnpm as a package manager that doesn't create giant
node_modules folders, light frameworks like Svelt or Preact keep the bundle small and lean, Vite instead of the tedious and slow webpack.
